<h2>PercentageGapInGroups</h2>
<p>Percentage that is used to calculate the min/max value that determines which elements belong in a SmallGroup
    together. E.G Which prices fall into the same "container".</p>
<p>For example, if the first price of a day is 1000, a value of 5 will allow all prices in the interval: <strong>951 →
    1050</strong>. With 951 being included, but 1050 not being included.</p>

<h2>MinimumGapInGroupsCents</h2>
<p>If this parameter yields a larger allowed interval than the result of PercentageGapInGroups, this value is used
    instead.</p>
<p>For example, if the first price is 1000 and it is set to 5%, any value above 50 will cause this parameter to be used
    instead. A value of 100 would yield the interval: <strong>901 → 1100</strong>, with 901 being included, but 1100
    not.</p>

<h2>MaximumGapInGroupsCents</h2>
<p>All grouping of prices will have at least 2 elements unless the difference between the prices is more than this
    value.</p>
<p>Example scenarios based on a value of 50:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Prices: <strong>100, 140, 149</strong> → The first two will be in a group, the third will not.</li>
    <li>Prices: <strong>100, 151, 120</strong> → 100 will be in a group by itself.</li>
    <li>Prices: <strong>100, 150, 120</strong> → All three will be in the same group.</li>
</ul>

<h2>PercentageGapBetweenGroups</h2>
<p>Percentage of gap between groups. If the average price of the cheapest group is 50 and this value is 5, we allow all
    other groups with an average price of less than <strong>52.5</strong> to be in the same column.</p>

<h2>MinimumGapBetweenGroups</h2>
<p>If this value exceeds the percentage gap above, this value is used instead.</p>
<p>For example, if this value is 50 and the cheapest group has an average of 50, then we allow all prices below <strong>100</strong>
    to be in the same column.</p>
